	bazel shutdown

	- Notes about Server Mode
	By default, Bazel uses a long-running server process as an optimization.
	When running Bazel in a script, don't forget to call shutdown when you're finished with the server,
	or, specify --max_idle_secs=5 so that idle servers shut themselves down promptly.
