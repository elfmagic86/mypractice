# network를 고려해야한다
: docker


# host network
: With the host driver, Docker does not manage any portion of the container
  networking stack such as port mapping or routing rules. This means that common
  networking flags like -p and --icc have no meaning for the host driver. They
  are ignored. This does make the host networking the simplest and lowest
  latency of the networking drivers. The traffic path goes directly from the
  container process to the host interface, offering bare-metal performance that
  is equivalent to a non-containerized process.
