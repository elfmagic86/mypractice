	- 의존관계
	:We have the projects “shared”, “api” and “personService”. The “personService”
	project has a lib dependency on the other two projects. The “api” project has
	a lib dependency on the “shared” project


	- 빌드 설명(build.gradle)
	:All the build logic is in the “build.gradle” file of the root project.
	 A “lib” dependency is a special form of an execution dependency. It
	causes the other project to be built first and adds the jar with the
	classes of the other project to the classpath. It also adds the
	dependencies of the other project to the classpath. So you can enter the
	“api” directory and trigger a “gradle compile”. First the “shared” project
	is built and then the “api” project is built. Project dependencies enable
	partial multi-project builds.
