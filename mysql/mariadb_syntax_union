	ALL, DISTINCT
	The ALL keyword causes duplicate rows to be preserved. The DISTINCT keyword (the default if the keyword is omitted) causes duplicate rows to be removed by the results.


	SELECT ...
	UNION [ALL | DISTINCT] SELECT ...
	[UNION [ALL | DISTINCT] SELECT ...]
	[ORDER BY [column [, column ...]]]
	[LIMIT {[offset,] row_count | row_count OFFSET offset}]
