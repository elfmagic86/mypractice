	It looks like your MySql session has the safe-updates option set. This means that you can't update or delete records without specifying a key (ex. primary key) in the where clause.

	Try:

	SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
	Or you can modify your query to follow the rule (use primary key in where clause).
