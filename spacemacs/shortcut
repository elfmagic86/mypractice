	- structure
	There are four top-level functions in the file: dotspacemacs/layers,
	dotspacemacs/init, dotspacemacs/user-init and dotspacemacs/user-config. The
	dotspacemacs/layers function exist only to enable and disable layers and
	packages. The dotspacemacs/init function is run before anything else during
	startup and contains Spacemacs settings. You will never need to touch this
	function except to change default Spacemacs settings. The
	dotspacemacs/user-init function is also run before anything else and contains
	user specific configuration. The dotspacemacs/user-config function is the one
	you will use the most. This is where you define any user configuration.

Spacemacs does not automatically restore your windows and buffers when you
reopen it. If you use vim sessions regularly you may want to set
dotspacemacs-auto-resume-layouts to t in your .spacemacs.

This function is called at the very end of Spacemacs initialization after

explicitly specified that a variable should be set before a package is loaded,
you should place your code here."
