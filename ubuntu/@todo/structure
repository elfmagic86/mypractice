  : 이 위치에 있는 파일들은 매일 클린됨
  https://askubuntu.com/questions/20783/how-is-the-tmp-directory-cleaned-up
  The cleaning of /tmp is done by the upstart script /etc/init/mounted-tmp.conf. The script is run by upstart everytime /tmp is mounted. Practically that means at every boot.

  - /proc
  : 프로세스정보. ps

  - /dev
  : 물리적장치(블락), 가상장치 등등..
