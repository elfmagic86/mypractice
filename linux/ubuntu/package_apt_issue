	how do you find this third party ppa? – Hölderlin Jan 19 at 16:18
	Google "[package] site:launchpad.net", click on the first result and
	scroll down to the end of the page and look for the green text that says "Other versions of '[package]' in untrusted archives",
	click on it and it will reveal a list of all ppa's containing the package – Rune Jan 19 at 16:45
