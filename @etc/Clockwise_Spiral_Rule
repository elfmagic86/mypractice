##
	[X] or []
	=> Array X size of... or Array undefined size of...
	(type1, type2)
	=> function passing type1 and type2 returning...
	*
	=> pointer(s) to...


## Examples

- char *str[10];
	What is str?
	str is an Array 10 of pointers to char

- char *(*fp)( int, float *);
	What is fp?
	fp is a pointer
	  to a function passing an int and a pointer to float
	    returning a pointer to a char

	답: ``fp is a pointer to a function passing an int and a pointer to float returning a pointer to a char''

- void (*signal(int, void (*fp)(int)))(int);
	What is signal?
		signal is a function passing a int and `fp`
			`void (*fp)(int)`: fp is a pointer to a function
								that passing an int returning void
		returning a pointer to function
			that passing an int returing void

	답: ``signal is a function passing an int and a pointer to a function passing an int returning nothing (void) returning a pointer to a function passing an int returning nothing (void)'

- const char *chptr;
	chptr is a pointer to a char constant

- char * const chptr;
	chptr is a constant pointer to a char

- volatile char * const chptr;
	chptr is a constant pointer to a char volatile
